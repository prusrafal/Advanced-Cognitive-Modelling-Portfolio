# Advanced Cognitive Modeling Portfolio

## Course Overview
This repository is part of the Advanced Cognitive Modeling course offered by the Mac Cognitive Science program at Aarhus University. It encompasses a series of group assignments aimed at understanding and modeling cognitive behaviors through the lens of the Matching Pennies Game.

## Project Structure
The repository is to be organized into four main entities, each corresponding to a specific assignment within the course:

- `Matching-Pennies-Game`: Introduction to the Matching Pennies Game and exploration of theoretical strategies.
- `Matching-Pennies-Game-Stan`: Detailed cognitive modeling of Matching Pennies Game strategies using Stan, a platform for statistical modeling and high-performance statistical computation - https://github.com/julifurjes/ACM_pf2
- `...`
- `...`

## Assignments Overview
1. **Matching Pennies Game**: Investigates two potential strategies for playing the Matching Pennies Game, laying the groundwork for cognitive modeling.
2. **Cognitive Model with Stan**: Builds upon the initial analysis to construct and validate a cognitive model using Stan, aimed at replicating matching pennies behavior.

## Getting Started
- Clone the repository to access the assignments and related materials.
- Each folder contains specific instructions and Jupyter Notebooks to guide you through the models and analyses.

## Contributing
This project is an academic submission. Contributions and feedback are welcome from course instructors and fellow students.

## Acknowledgements
Special thanks to Aarhus University's Mac Cognitive Science faculty for providing guidance and resources for these assignments.
